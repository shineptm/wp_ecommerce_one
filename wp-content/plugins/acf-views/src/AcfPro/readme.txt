This folder contains Repeater & Clone features from the 'Advanced Custom Fields PRO' plugin (5.12.2), as 'ACF Views' UI requires
these features, so it's done to make possible use of 'ACF Views' with 'Advanced Custom Fields' (not PRO).

The files are executed only in case there is no active 'ACF PRO' plugin.
'ACF' plugin released under 'GPLv2 or later' license (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html) so no rights are broken.

Repeater & Clone fields marked as private (see '_custom' in PHP), so they work only in a 'back compatibility' mode,
adding new fields with these types by user isn't possible.

'Gutenberg block' feature is available only with 'Advanced Custom Fields PRO' plugin.

We highly recommend use of 'Advanced Custom Fields PRO' plugin.
